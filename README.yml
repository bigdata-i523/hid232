        Big Data is rapidly becoming a crucial component in the majority of the
        fields, be it from medicine to software. Big data technologies help in
        processing humongous amounts of data in a rapid manner while enabling
        us to achieve results fast and accurately. Big data is becoming a key
        player in the restoration of ecological assets like water, forests and
        the likes. Real time analysis of assets all over the world and the
        changes are documented and stored how this data can be used and for
        what purpose is the penultimate question. We dissect the various
        stages of the rainwater harvesting process and show how the
        application of big data to each stage can enhance the process.

        Hearing disability is a huge problem to the very fabric of society.
        It causes great discomfort among those who suffer from it and in some
        extreme cases can cause alienation. Thus there is a need for society
        to accept the difficulties faced by those are affected with hearing
        disabilities and enhance the traditional solutions offered with the
        latest technologies so that they can lead a life without difficulties
        and live a normal life. The paper shows how the latest big data
        trends can be applied to existing traditional solutions like hearing
        aid , captions and also suggests how it can used to proactively
        avoid situations that could lead to hearing loss. It is hoped that
        an interest will be generated towards further reserach and
        implementaion towards combining Big data with hearing
        difficulty solutions.

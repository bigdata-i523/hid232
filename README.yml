    abstract: >
        Big Data is rapidly becoming a crucial component in the majority of the
        fields, be it from medicine to software. Big data technologies help in
        processing humongous amounts of data in a rapid manner while enabling
        us to achieve results fast and accurately. Big data is becoming a key
        player in the restoration of ecological assets like water, forests and
        the likes. Real time analysis of assets all over the world and the
        changes are documented and stored how this data can be used and for
        what purpose is the penultimate question. We dissect the various
        stages of the rainwater harvesting process and show how the
        application of big data to each stage can enhance the process.
